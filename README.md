# ADS with programming abstraction
Autonomous driving system with programming abstraction!
This repository is a minimal example project to extrapolate the real systems with programming abstraction

# Mechanism
Baseline:
    1. read an image
    2. detect objects
        - BB(Bounding box) will be used
    3. done

Proposal
    1. Read an image
    2. detect objects
    3. process only interesting objects


# TODO
- [x] Define functions
- [x] Make a skeleton code
- [x] Extract bounding box data from images
- [] measure uncertainty based on velocity
- [] manual-labeling on interesting objs
- [] meaure latency when the system only processes labeled objects
